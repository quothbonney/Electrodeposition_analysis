# TUDEL (TU Digital Electrochemistry Lab)

TUDEL is developed by Jack D.V. Carson for the Chemistry Summer Undergraduate Research Program (CSURP) at Tulsa University under an MIT License. 
It is a toolkit for photoanalysis of electrochemical films primarily intended for the synthesis of Perovskite-based solar cells. The primary feature of the
repository is quantitative measurements regarding color, uniformity, and quality of created films.
