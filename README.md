# TUDEL (TU Digital Electrochemistry Lab)

TUDEL is developed by Jack D.V. Carson for the Chemistry Summer Undergraduate Research Program (CSURP) at Tulsa University under an MIT License. 
It is a toolkit for photoanalysis of electrochemical films primarily intended for the synthesis of Perovskite-based solar cells. The primary feature of the
repository is quantitative measurements regarding color, uniformity, and quality of created films.

The project will hopefully soon become an plugin to the [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) application, however due to the dependencies of the project and the interpreted syntax of Python, it is currently only avaiable as a command line interface (CLI).
